As an expert content writer, now focus on the specific section "{SECTION}" of the article, as provided in the data-focused prompt's outline.

Here are the instructions to follow:

1. Consult the outline to gauge the depth required for covering each topic within this section. 
If a topic has its own subsection, provide an overview without going into detail, as these points will be explored in-depth separately. 
For topics without specific subsections, cover them comprehensively within this section. 
This approach ensures a balanced and informed presentation that respects the article's structure.

2. Format the content using Markdown syntax to enhance readability and structure. Use headings (e.g., '##' for H2, '###' for H3) to organize the content hierarchically. 
Bold key points for important emphasis, but use this sparingly to maintain effectiveness. 
Employ tables, bullet lists, and numbered lists strategically to support the content and improve reader comprehension.

3. Write comprehensively about "{SECTION}" and its subsections, as indicated in the outline. Do not write about the sections that follow.

4. Integrate the internal linking data into this section as specified. Here are the internal link(s) to add in the content:
{INTERNAL_LINKS}

5. Apply the AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) engagement strategy to keep readers engaged throughout the section. Do not explain the reasoning behind your writing strategy.

6. Ensure the content seamlessly connects with the previously written sections, maintaining coherence and logical flow.

7. Tailor the style and tone to suit the audience and maintain consistency with the desired tone(s) specified in the data-focused prompt.

8. Review the factual information provided in the data-focused prompt. Incorporate only the facts that are relevant and appropriate to the current section ("{SECTION}"). Ensure that the selected facts are presented naturally, support the main points, and enhance the content's credibility.

9. Conclude the section without referencing or hinting at the content of the following sections. Avoid using phrases that suggest a final summary or conclusion, such as 'in summary' or 'in conclusion'.

10. Once this section is complete, stop and wait for further instructions for the next section of the article.
